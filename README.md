The Make feature in automobile dataset refers to the manufacturer or brand of the vehicle. It's a categorical feature that provides information about the company that produced the car.
The "Make" feature represents the name of the car manufacturer or brand, such as "Toyota", "Honda","BMW" and so on.

#### 4. Fuel-Type:
The Fuel Type feature in a dataset refers to the type of fuel used to power vehicles. It's a categorical attribute that classifies vehicles based on the energy source they rely on for their engines.
The two main categories are usually "Diesel" and "Gas" fuel.
Diesel Fuel:
Diesel engines run on diesel fuel, which is less refined than gas. Diesel vehicles tend to be more fuel-efficient and have better torque, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications.
Gas Fuel:
Gas engines use gas as their primary fuel source. Gas is more commonly used for everyday vehicles and has different combustion characteristics compared to diesel.

2."FWD" (Front-Wheel Drive)- In a front-wheel drive configuration, the engine's power is transmitted to the front wheels.
3."RWD" (Rear-Wheel Drive)- In a rear-wheel drive configuration, the engine's power is sent to the rear wheels.

#### 9. Engine-Location:
The Engine Location feature in a dataset refers to the position where the engine of a vehicle is located within the vehicle's chassis. It's a categorical attribute that provides information about the arrangement of the engine.
Front Engine:
The most common engine location is at the front of the vehicle. In front-engine vehicles, the engine is positioned in the front compartment, usually under the hood.
Rear Engine:
In rear-engine vehicles, the engine is located at the rear of the vehicle, typically behind the rear axle.

#### 10. Wheel-Base:
Wheel Base is a key feature in your automobile dataset that refers to the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels of a vehicle. This measurement provides insights into the vehicle's stability, handling, and overall dimensions.

#### 11. Length:
the Length feature represents the length of a vehicle. It's a numerical attribute that provides information about the physical dimensions of the car.

#### 12. Width:
The Width feature in your automobile dataset refers to the width of the vehicle. It's a numerical attribute that provides information about the horizontal dimensions of a car.

#### 13. Height:
The Height feature in your automobile dataset refers to the vertical measurement of the vehicle from the ground to its highest point.

#### 14. Curb-Weight:
Curb Weight is an important feature in your automobile dataset that refers to the weight of a vehicle when it's fully equipped with all standard items, including essential fluids, fuel, and a full complement of passengers and cargo.

#### 15. Engine-Type:
The Engine Type feature in your automobile dataset describes the type of engine used in each vehicle. It's a categorical attribute that provides information about the configuration and design of the internal combustion engine.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate Analysis)
#### 1.	Univariate Data Analysis
Use sweetviz library and generate a html report of all feature to do univariate analysis, In that we get the Minimum, Maximum, Some statistical information of the particular feature.
#### 2.	Bivariate Data Analysis
In Bivariate analysis we check the relation of independent feature with respect to target variable

#### 3.	Multivariate Data AnalysisÂ¶
In Multivariate analysis we check the relation of two independent feature with respect to target variable

### Data Preprocessing
â¢	First we check the missing values, and we seen that the  5-6 feature has contain missing value and impute them with median and mode.
â¢	Handle categorical data and use Manual encoding and frequency encoding. Because features has contain lots of label.
â¢	In this data Iâm Clearly seen that some feature has lots of outlier & we impute them, for that first we check the distribution of all feature and plot the box plot and decide the technique.
â¢	Scale the numerical independent feature with the help of standard scalar and scale the feature. Because standard scaling give me the best result of ML model.

### Feature Scaling
â¢	Check the correlation with the help of heatmap and seen the two feature has highly correlated with each other, and we decide to drop one feature i.e City-mpg
â¢	The dataset not contain any duplicates

### Model Creation & Evaluation
â¢	Define Independent and dependant variable and split the data into training and testing.
â¢	For Training 80% & Testing 20% data
â¢	Use linear regression ,decision tree XGBoost regression algorithm to get a best result and XGB regression is give best result. i.e R2 Score 92.28% and Adjusted R2 Score is 80.72% with 2424 RMSE 

### Model Saving
Â·	Save the model using pickle file
